# Contributing

At the moment Boardgames project has (severely) limited support for contributions. If you decide to contribute keep in mind the (very low) expectations you should have from me, as listed below. Reasoning is that supporting contributions properly takes time and I am not ready for that commitment.

You could:

* Open GitHub issue(s) to let me know your thoughts and/or propose changes, but **don't expect me to reply** promptly (i.e., there could be delay of several months), if at all.
* (If for a particular issue I ask for a pull request) Implement per agreement in the issue and send pull request, but **don't expect me to review/merge the pull request** promptly (i.e., there could be delay of several months), if at all.
* (Discouraged, but allowed) Create unsolicited pull request, but **don't expect me to review it/merge it**.
